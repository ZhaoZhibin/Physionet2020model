# Physionet2020model

This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of our model in Classification of 12-lead ECGs: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020. The related paper was accepted by the CinC2020 and titled
"[**Adaptive Lead Weighted ResNet Trained With Different Duration Signals for
Classifying 12-lead ECGs**](https://physionetchallenges.github.io/2020/papers/112.pdf)" 
by [Zhibin Zhao](https://zhaozhibin.github.io/). 

Our team, named Between_a_ROC_and_a_heart_place, came 2nd in the [**CinC/Physionet challenge88**](https://physionetchallenges.github.io/2020/)
